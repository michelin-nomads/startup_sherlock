# Startup Sherlock - Demo Video Narration

## 🎬 Opening Scene (0:00 - 0:30)

"Welcome to **Startup Sherlock** – your AI-powered investment analyst that helps you make smarter, data-driven decisions when evaluating startups.

Investing in startups is risky. According to research, 90% of startups fail, and 42% fail because of no market need. But what if you could analyze startups like a professional VC firm – in minutes instead of weeks?

That's where Startup Sherlock comes in."

## 🔍 The Problem (0:30 - 1:00)

"Traditional startup due diligence is:
- **Time-consuming**: Manual analysis takes weeks of research
- **Expensive**: Professional analysts charge thousands per report

Individual investors and small VC firms need a better way to evaluate opportunities without breaking the bank."

### Feature 4: Public Data Verification (3:45 - 5:00)

**[Show public data analysis tab]**

"Here's what makes Startup Sherlock truly unique: **Hybrid Research System**.

Most platforms only analyze what startups *tell you*. We verify it against **real public data**.

**How It Works:**
1. **Gemini with Web Grounding**: Google's AI searches the web in real-time for information about the startup
2. **Custom Google Search**: Pulls data from authoritative sources like Crunchbase, TechCrunch, LinkedIn, Forbes
3. **Multi-Source Synthesis**: Combines findings from multiple sources with confidence scoring

**What We Verify:**
- **Company Information**: Website, founding date, headquarters, registration
- **Team & Founders**: LinkedIn profiles, previous companies, education
- **Funding History**: Actual rounds raised, investors, valuations
- **News & Media**: Recent coverage, sentiment analysis, credibility
- **Business Registry**: Legal status, incorporation details
- **Domain Information**: Registration date, ownership verification

**Confidence Scoring:**
Every piece of public data comes with a confidence score (0-100%) showing how reliable the information is.

Sources are ranked by relevance:
- High relevance: Official company websites, verified registries
- Medium relevance: News articles, third-party profiles
- Low relevance: Forum discussions, unverified sources"

---

### Feature 5: Discrepancy Analysis (5:00 - 6:00)

**[Show comparison tab]**

"Now comes the magic: **Automated Discrepancy Detection**.

Startup Sherlock compares what the startup claims in their documents versus what public data shows.

**Side-by-Side Comparison Table:**
| Field | Document Claims | Public Data | Status |
|-------|----------------|-------------|--------|
| Founded Year | 2019 | 2020 (Business Registry) | ⚠️ Different |
| Total Funding | $5M | $3.2M (Crunchbase) | ⚠️ Different |
| Employees | 50+ | 23 (LinkedIn) | ⚠️ Different |
| Annual Revenue | $2M | Not Found | ⚠️ Unverified |

**Discrepancy Severity Levels:**
- **Critical**: Major mismatches that could indicate fraud
- **High**: Significant differences requiring explanation
- **Medium**: Moderate inconsistencies worth investigating
- **Low**: Minor variances, possibly due to timing or definitions

**Red Flag Generation:**
If discrepancies are severe, the system generates red flags:
- 'Funding amount discrepancy: $5M claimed vs $3.2M verified'
- 'Team size inflated by 117%'
- 'Revenue claims cannot be verified through any public source'

**Confidence Assessment:**
- Document Reliability Score: Based on internal consistency
- Public Data Reliability Score: Based on source quality
- Overall Confidence: Your trust level in the analysis

This transparency helps you make informed decisions with full context."
